Welcome to Bjet_MCMC
===================================

**Bjet_MCMC** is a MCMC python wrapper around the C++ code Bjet. It can be used to automatically model multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of blazars, considering one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model with or without the addition of external inverse-Compton process from the thermal emission of the nucleus. It also contains functionalities for multi-zone SSC modeling.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
