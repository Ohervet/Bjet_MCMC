Welcome to Bjet_MCMC
===================================

**Bjet_MCMC** is a tool to to automatically model multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of blazars, considering one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model with or without the addition of external inverse-Compton process from the thermal emission of the nucleus. It also contains manual fitting functionalities for multi-zone SSC modeling.
This tool is built as an MCMC python wrapper around the C++ code Bjet.
